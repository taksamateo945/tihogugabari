Previously, BOSSIP reported on the termination of <a href=#>former police chief Sam Dobbins</a> after a Black officer outed him for bragging about how many Black people he had killed and abused. You can’t make this s**t up.</p><p>Today, we have a new shining example of the rot that dwells inside law enforcement agencies. According to <a href=#>News One</a>, a Mississippi Highway Patrol officer in McComb was seen being unnecessarily physical with a man who had already complied and had been placed in handcuffs. Eugene Lewis says he was pulled over by the unidentified patrolman and asked does he smoke or drink. He told the officer that he does not smoke and had not had a drink at the time. Fortunately, Eugene’s brothers, Packer and Darius Lewis, were on the scene to record what would become a violent interaction.</p><p>You can hear one of the men say, “We don’t give a damn…you was just in the back seat beating him up,” in response to the threat of arrest by an officer who sounds guilty as f**k. It appears that the brothers both witnessed the patrolman attacking Eugene in the back of his police cruiser. Subsequently, all three men were arrested. Eugene Lewis spoke to WJTV about the incident.</p><p>McComb Mayor Quordiniah Lockle released the following statement asking for patience but also that the public not bite their tongues in speaking out against injustice:</p><p>“I know that many of you like myself, have viewed the video of the Mississippi Highway Patrol Officer and Mr. Eugene Lewis. I am alarmed as well as disturbed over it. Last night, after viewing it several times, I contacted Representative Daryl Porter and asked him to intervene on behalf of the City of McComb since it involved a Highway Patrol Officer. I was informed this morning that an internal investigation was going to be conducted. I ask that you allow the investigation to be completed but at the same time let your voice be heard.”</p><p>We’ll be keeping an eye on this story as it develops.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOpqCsq5mowKq8z6JkraqfpL2mvoysnJ6mXZeyqrrGZq2ip5yau7V51qKroWWRob%2BmrcOyZKGZnpmwtrLFnptmpZGjfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pia-zadora-in-intensive-care-with-head-injury-after-golf-cart-fall-2014139.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pia Zadora In Intensive Care With Head Injury After Golf Cart Fall</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./melanie-lynskey-divorcing-jimmi-simpson-2012110.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Melanie Lynskey Divorcing Jimmi Simpson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
