He began developing an interest in rap music in the late 1980s, and eventually began recording his own songs, releasing his debut album Fools from the Streets in 1993 to moderate success in the Bay Area. The local success of his album led to him being signed to Relativity Records, a Sony Music imprint to release his second album Explicit Game in 1994. The album spawned Dru Down’s most successful single to date, Pimp of the Year, which peaked at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single stayed on Billboard for 24 weeks.</p><p>Dru Down’s third album, Can You Feel Me, was released in 1996, and spawned a single of the same name that was a minor but commercial hit. It also featured Dru Down’s first and only collaboration with his father, Bootsy Collins. One of the album’s songs, Mista Busta addresses Dru Down’s then-ongoing feud with fellow Bay Area rapper Too Short, and serves as a diss track towards Too Short. The album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200, and was critically praised, receiving a 4/5 star rating from Allmusic. That same year, Dru Down began his acting career, appearing in the movie Original Gangstas as Kayo. He also appeared on the 2Pac song “All About You” from 2Pac’s fourth studio album All Eyez on Me, where he performs the intro.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dru Down</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dzmitry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hintaw</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oakland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dru Down ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
