"I've always been one of those guys where it's just play, you get hurt and now it's going to hurt when you're playing. I've never really thought about down the road, family, future. Unfortunately, when you take a hit like that, it really affects the people around you."</p><p>Hurst suffered a concussion in the Panthers' loss to the Chicago Bears on Nov. 9. His head whiplashed to the ground after Bears safety Jaquan Brisker broke up a pass attempt.</p><p>Jerry Hurst, Hayden's father, <a href=# rel=noopener>announced</a> on Dec. 6 that his son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic amnesia by an independent neurologist and they didn't "know when he'll be back" playing football.</p><p>Hayden told Newton his father's post on social media was because he "got pissed off" that people were speaking negatively against his son.</p><p>"I'm like, Dad, I could pull up numerous tweets of people saying that I suck or blah, blah, blah. But he felt a certain way and I was like, 'Hey, man, you're 65 years old. If you want to fire off a tweet, do anything you want," Hayden said.</p><p>One day after his father's announcement, Hayden clarified the injury was "NOT" career-ending and he was trying to get back on the field this season.</p>Hayden Hurst <span class=acct>@haydenrhurst</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>While it was scary, it is NOT career ending. I'm starting my return to play this week, so fingers crossed I make it back for the last few weeks!&lt;br>God Bless &amp;amp; Keep Pounding !!!!</p><p>Hurst explained he's still dealing with the effects of the post-traumatic amnesia, but his fiancée has been there to provide support.</p><p>"Like last week, we were sitting there watching TV and we ordered lunch and within like 30 minutes I asked her five times what we were doing for lunch," Hurst told Newton. "She's consistent for me, which is perfect for me because this is unchartered territory. I've played through torn ligaments and broken bones, but I've never had memory loss."</p><p>Hurst explained he had a four-hour gap in his memories between the time he was being evaluated in the medical tent on the field and waking up on the team plane later that same day.</p><p>"That was the scary part," he said.</p><p>Newton noted that Hurst is hoping to be cleared of step four in the five-part process required by the NFL for a player to be allowed to play again.</p><p>The Panthers took the possibility of Hurst getting on the field this season away by placing him on <a href=# rel=noopener>injured reserve</a> on Dec. 15.</p><p>Hurst signed a three-year contract with Carolina as a free agent in March. He previously played for the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons and Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>The 30-year-old finished the 2023 campaign with 18 receptions, 184 yards and one touchdown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGaGc36MqZinrJiav7R5x5qwnZ2eYrW2vtKtZK2ZnKDAbrzOrKtmrKKWwq6t06KaZpmdo7K0tcBmp6WZnqh6tbuMppiknV2js6150Z6rrqqeYrqwvsQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dog-buys-treats-on-his-own.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Dog Figured Out How To Buy Treats On His Own</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10124846-tmz-nfl-legend-bill-belichick-dating-24-year-old-former-cheerleader-jordon-hudson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>TMZ: NFL Legend Bill Belichick Dating 24-Year Old Former Cheerleader Jordon Hudson | News, Scores, H</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
