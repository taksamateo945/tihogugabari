Her parents were hippies, and the information about her father is unavailable. However, our sources say Nadine’s mother was 19, and her father was 20 when she was born.</p><p>The name Nadine is of French origin, which means hope.</p><p>Nadine is a Scorpio. A Scorpio woman is passionate, ambitious, and assertive; however, they can be jealous and resentful. She was a stubborn and strong-headed person since always. Nadine Caridi chose peace over anything, whether coming out of a toxic marriage or setting boundaries with her parents.</p><p>Her parents must have migrated to the US when she was young. Nadine’s family started living in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York. As a result, Nadine Caridi spent almost all her childhood and youth in New York.</p><p>People recognize her as the “Duchess of Bay Ridge,” which Jordan used to call him.</p><p>She went to John Dewey High School in Southern Brooklyn for her studies. After completing primary school in 1980, Nadine wanted to be a model. Enrolling at the university was not her priority back then.</p><p>Nadine Caridi had an interest in sports and fashion. She was an ambitious woman. Her ambitions and hard work brought her to the place she is today.</p><p>Per her Instagram post on October 11, 2019, she defeated two cancers. Going to therapy and learning to love her became one of my most outstanding achievements. Today, nothing from her past brings chaos to her, not her cancer, not her mental health, and not even her toxic marriage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=nadine-caridi-family>Family</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=suzanne-caridi-mother>Suzanne Caridi (mother)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nadine-Caridi-photo-with-her-mother-and-father.jpg><p>The mother of Nadine Caridi was young when she was born.
