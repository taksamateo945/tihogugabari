Since Emily started her own clothing line Inamorata Woman, she mostly poses in her own garments — including her bikinis and one-piece bathing suits. Things took a bit of an unusual turn when Emily shared a photo of herself seated on an airplane with her 26.6 million Instagram followers and thanked the clothing company Livincool for the photo. It appears that Livincool sent Emily a framed print of herself from the flight. Emily shared the original photo and then a second picture of the framed print on her wall. Her dog Colombo could be seen in the photo’s background looking on from the kitchen.</p><p>Emily hashtagged Livincool in the Instagram post and at the same time as Emily’s post, Livincool shared several throwback photos of Emily looking stunning in their swimwear.</p><p>Livincool shared the following photo slideshow with the caption that you may see below.</p><p>“<span title=Edited>Summertime at its best&nbsp;@emrata&nbsp;#LivincoolArchives.”</span></p><p>Emily looked gorgeous with a picturesque setting that included blue, tranquil water in the background. Emily wore her hair parted down the middle and captured in a low twist at the nape of her neck. Holding a glass of wine in one hand and an oyster on a shell in the other, Emily gave the camera a sultry look.</p><p>Her makeup was natural in appearance and looked sun-kissed with coral lipstick and eyeshadow. Emily flaunted her gorgeous figure and showed off her ample cleavage and toned abs in the pose.</p><p>A second photo in the slideshow captured Emily in the same setting, only instead of looking to the side, she stared directly into the camera. A third photo showed Emily’s backside as she walked upon rocks in only a thong.</p><p>You may see the photo slideshow that Livincool shared below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBs-7tcJl56/</p><p>You may see the post that Emily shared of herself seated on an airplane along with the framed print that she has hanging on her wall below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBtcFGbpACk/</p><p>Emily is just one of the many celebrities who wear Livincool. Sofia Richie recently did a photo shoot for the brand and they have a very popular swimsuit and athleticwear line. Are you a fan of the brand?
