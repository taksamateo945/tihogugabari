Cleopatra Bernard, his mother, posted an audio clip to her IG account in which Tentacion claimed he wanted his ex, Geneva Ayala, to be a part of a music video sometime in the future.</p><p>In an April 2018 recording, XXXTentaction claimed he wanted to bring his ex-girlfriend into the project “in a weird way.” The rapper added that he felt as though bringing her into the video would be “amazing,” and would give him the power he wanted through the ability to capture other people’s minds.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3wxyH9j2Ew/</p><p>In the short video, it shows Ayala eating what appears to be a heart, while XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jaseh Onfroy, raps in the background asking why she ate his heart. X’s mom captioned the post by shouting out to the director of the video, James Pereira, whom she praised for bringing his vision to life.</p><p>Furthermore, Peira, the video director, shared the clip and explained in the caption that the audio recording was of him and X explaining how he wanted to bring a certain vibe and aesthetic to the music video. At the time of his tragic passing last year, XXXTentaction was awaiting his trial for supposedly assaulting his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>X was fatally shot and killed while outside a motorcycle store in Florida in June of 2018. Once he passed away, Ayala claimed she was heartbroken. The ex-girlfriend of X stated she thought it “was disgusting” that people were speaking for her. Ayala added that it was painful to see X had lost his life.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>XXXTentaction, both before and after his death, was considered as a controversial figure for his contributions to the hip-hop scene, but also for his raucous past. However, his brand of emotional hip-hop secured him a dedicated following right up until his passing. Since then, his family and record label revealed that more posthumous music from the artist would be released.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeorcW1sc2tmJyhn6PAbrLOq6Seql2ctrO4xaugnqaUYsSpu8xmn55lkaG5prPEnaOyZZGowKLBy62cnWWnnbatsYypqZ6fnpa7tXnRnqeoqqSasa3FjKycnqZdnrtuusSwZKmno6m1trnOrqpmpaWotqR51aKbnqddaIByhJduZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerians-taunt-central-bank-governor-for-threatening-abokifx-founder-ask-if-naira-is-now-equal-to-a-dollar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerians Taunt Central Bank Governor For Threatening AbokiFX Founder, Ask If Naira Is Now Equal To</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./exclamation-after-a-close-call-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Exclamation after a close call</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
