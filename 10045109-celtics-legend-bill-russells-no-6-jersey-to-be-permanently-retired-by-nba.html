"Permanently retiring his No. 6 across every NBA team ensures that Bill’s transcendent career will always be recognized."</p><p>The number retirement begins with immediate effect, though players who already wear No. 6 can continue to do so.</p><p>In 1997, MLB <a href=# rel=noopener>retired</a> Jackie Robinson's No. 42 jersey to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Robinson breaking the color barrier.</p><p>Russell, who died at age 88 on July 31, is the first player to have his jersey retired by the NBA. It's a distinction befitting his achievements on the court and his legacy off it.</p><p>The 6'10" center won two consecutive titles at the University of San Francisco before becoming a 12-time All-Star, an 11-time NBA champion and a five-time MVP. He averaged 16.2 points and 24.9 rebounds across a 13-year career, establishing himself as one of the greatest players of all time.</p><p>The Celtics named him their player/head coach in 1966, making him the first Black head coach in the NBA. He won back-to-back titles in that role in 1968 and 1969.</p><p>Russell was also a civil rights pioneer. He took part in Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington in 1963 and was among the athletes to support Muhammad Ali at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Cleveland Summit</a>. In 1961, he was at the <a href=# rel=noopener>center of a boycott</a> by Celtics players ahead of an exhibition in Lexington, Kentucky, because two of his teammates, Sam Jones and Thomas Sanders, were denied service at a local coffee shop.</p><p>Russell also didn't shy away from <a href=# rel=noopener>recounting the racism</a> he experienced in Boston while helping turn the Celtics into a dynasty in the 1960s.</p><p>Sociologist Harry Edwards described Russell as "brilliant" in a 2019 interview with Andscape's <a href=# rel=noopener>Martenzie Johnson</a>.</p><p>"He is probably the most brilliant, intellectually, athlete that I have ever come across, and one of the most brilliant people that I’ve come across," Edwards said.</p><p>Basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reflected to Johnson on how Russell impacted his own activism.</p><p>"The thing that most affected me was that he approached injustice with passion, but he expressed himself rationally rather than with anger,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “Anger never persuaded anyone to your side, but logic did. That was an approach I tried to adopt."</p><p>In addition to retiring his jersey, the NBA will celebrate Russell's life by having every team wear a commemorative jersey patch and place a commemorative logo on the sideline near the scorer's table.</p><p>President Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZGp%2BcYWMnJylrJmYwG64xKCcp5xdl7atuIyrrKyrlaG5tHnNqGRvZZqav7Sx2GarqGWSmnqxsdGmmKednqm5unnRnquiqpWZeqPFjKeZmg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-doroshina-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Maria Doroshina Dating Boyfriend Or Single?
