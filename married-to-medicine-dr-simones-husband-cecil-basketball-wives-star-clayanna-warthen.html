Another commenter stated, “I never would think Cecil would be watching this show…like ever lmfaoo.”&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by RealityEntertainmentTV (@realityentertainmenttv)</a></p><p>Despite the commotion surrounding his post neither Dr. Simone nor any of her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“M2M” cast </a>mates have responded to his message. The OB-GYN has remained quiet about her husband’s recent opinions, but she was once almost “done” with him.</p><p>Back in January 2018, Dr. Simone revealed that she had <a href=#>filed for divorce months</a> prior in October during an interview with People magazine.</p><p>“I have reached a place where I am in a marriage where I do not feel loved and no sacrifices are being made for me to make me feel loved,” she shared of their 21-year marriage at the time. “I must move on.”&nbsp;</p><p>She added, “There is no if here, there are no games. I am not pretending. I am done.”&nbsp;</p><p>As previously reported, Cecil’s close relationship with a female friend made Dr. Simone uncomfortable and often led to frequent arguments or her storming out of restaurants.</p><p>She said had been vocal “for years” about Cecil minimizing his friendship with a woman named “Tammy” he once invited to <a href=#>spend Christmas with</a> at their family home for over a week even though she resides in Atlanta. Dr. Simone even accused him and Tammy of having a stronger “emotional” relationship than she and Cecil had.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>While taping the season 5 reunion, Dr. Simone reportedly informed her cast mates about her and Cecil’s decision to separate. However, the couple chose to give their marriage another try by the time the season 5 reunion aired in March 2018.</p><p>Their tough road back to a healthy relationship that was documented throughout season 6 of “M2M” included attending couples therapy as well as moving back into the same house.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Simone and Cecil are the <a href=#>longest-married couple</a> who have been on the popular Bravo series. They are also two of the few original cast members who are still on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo met nearly 40 years ago in Atlanta while attending Morehouse and Spelman colleges. Throughout their relationship, Dr. Simone and Cecil have welcomed two sons; 25-year-old Miles Whitmore and 21-year-old Michael Whitmore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmlsX6Kus77InptmrJ9iuqawyJygp51dmb9uv8impqedo2K1tr%2FBmqWdZZOasKq4jJuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtmrqKulah6tMDAq2ScpJGurq%2B6wGaumqqknbKvew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mecia-simson-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-family-and-origin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mecia Simson Wiki: Whats Her Ethnicity?
