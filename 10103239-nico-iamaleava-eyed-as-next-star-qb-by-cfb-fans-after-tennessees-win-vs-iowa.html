He threw for 151 yards and a touchdown on 12-of-19 passing with no turnovers and added three rushing touchdowns in the victory.</p><p>Iamaleava was a 5-star recruit and the No. 2 quarterback in the class of 2023, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports' composite</a>. At 18 years old, he has shown that he already has a level of maturity well beyond his years by playing a clean game against an Iowa defense that ranked third in the nation with opponents averaging 13.2 points and fifth with 274.8 yards allowed per game. Tennessee should feel confident in having him as the program's quarterback of the future.</p><p>Fans on social media couldn't hold back their excitement after seeing Iamaleava's breakout performance on Monday:</p>Jack McGuire <span class=acct>@JackMacCFB</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am so on board the Nico Iamaleava hype train. &lt;br>&lt;br>CFB's 1st Anime QB.</p>Brandon Marsonek <span class=acct>@Marsonek34</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nico Iamaleava is going to be the Heisman next year</p>Keegan Nickoson <span class=acct>@Knickoson42</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cheez-it bowl showing the disparity between the SEC and everybody else. &lt;br>&lt;br>Also, Nico Iamaleava might be the truth.</p>Nathanael Rutherford <span class=acct>@Mr_Rutherford</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nico Iamaleava's 4 total TDs are the most by a Vol freshman QB in their 1st start since Tyler Bray had 5 TDs vs. Memphis in 2010</p>Tom VanHaaren <span class=acct>@TomVH</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Iowa's defense is a tough test for a freshman quarterback who hasn't played a ton.
