But Hall’s journey to the top couldn’t have been more different from Paljor’s.</p><p>The New Zealander had always been passionate about climbing as a recreational sport. From his youth in the Southern Alps to his challenging climbs as a young adult, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fostered an intense enthusiasm for mountaineering</a>, one that overflowed when he met the likeminded Gary Ball. The pair soon devised a shared goal to climb the “Seven Summits.”</p><p>The Seven Summits challenge dared contenders to climb the tallest mountain on each continent in succession. The “Seven Summits” were Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Kosciuszko in Australia, and Vinson in Antarctica.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-304000 alt="Jason Clarke As Rob Hall" width=900 height=619 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/jason-clarke-as-rob-hall.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-304000 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Universal Pictures</span><span class=caption-body>Jason Clarke as Rob Hall in 2015’s Everest, which was based on Jon Krakauer’s 1997 book, Into Thin Air.</span></p><p>To the amazement of onlookers worldwide, the duo accomplished the feat in 1990 in record time — seven peaks in seven months. Soon, the pair opened their own expedition guiding company, Adventure Consultants, in 1992. But that same year, the pair would return to Everest in an expedition that claimed Ball’s life.</p><p>Ball’s cause of death was HAPE, or high-altitude pulmonary edema. He was buried by his partner in a crevasse. Traumatized yet adamant to retain his passion, Hall continued to guide expeditions up Mount Everest until that last fateful expedition in 1996.</p><p>Among his more than 300 clients on that fateful trip were Beck Weathers, who dreamed of accomplishing the Seven Summits feat like his guide. Hall was also guiding journalist Jon Krakauer up the mountain, whose 1997 book Into Thin Air was adapted into the 2015 adventure film Everest.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303999 alt="Rob Hall Memorial" width=900 height=603 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rob-hall-memorial.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303999 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The memorial built for Hall, Hansen, and climbers Andy Harris and Yasuko Namba.</span></p><p>The climb on May 10 began smoothly enough, but nightfall yielded serious visibility issues, with Weathers being forced to stay behind and wait for the group’s return from the summit.</p><p>Nevertheless successfully reaching Everest’s peak by 3 p.m., the group began their descent and encountered an incapacitated climber named Doug Hansen. Hall stayed with him as sherpas led the group down. But with a blizzard and 150 mile-per-hour winds swooping in shortly after, Hall and Hansen were stuck.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="Beck Weathers" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img//thumb/300.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/beck-weathers-cover.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> History Uncovered Podcast Episode 28: Beck Weathers’ Harrowing Survival Atop Mount Everest After he was seen being blown away by gale-force winds in Mount Everest's "Death Zone," Beck Weathers' wife was notified that her husband was dead. What happened next was nothing short of a miracle.</a><p>Twelve hours later, Hansen was dead. Though one of Hall’s guides had begun to ascend with extra oxygen, the would-be rescuer went missing. Hall had managed to fix his broken mask regulator by 9 a.m. the following morning, but it was too late, as his hands and feet were already severely frostbitten.</p><p>“Sleep well my sweetheart,” he told his wife on satellite phone. “Please don’t worry too much.”</p><p>Hall’s body remains in the spot where he perished to this day, and continues to be one of the most well-known of all the dead bodies on Mount Everest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuu9Snq2adppq%2Fpr%2FTZpuemaSdwHCE</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dua-lipa-releases-new-single-physical-and-announces-album-pre-order.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dua Lipa releases new single 'Physical' and announces album pre-order</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sticky-stuff-on-bark-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sticky stuff on bark</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
