remember the thrilling adventures of Carmen and Juni Cortez, the siblings who discovered that their parents were secret agents and joined them in saving the world from various villains.</p><p>The first three movies, released between 2001 and 2003, were huge hits that made stars out of Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, who played Carmen and Juni respectively.</p><p>But what about the fourth movie, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World, which came out in 2011?</p><p>This movie introduced a new pair of spy kids, Rebecca and Cecil Wilson, who were the stepchildren of Marissa Wilson, a retired OSS agent who came back to action to stop a madman called the Time Keeper from destroying the world.</p><p>The movie also featured Jessica Alba as Marissa, Joel McHale as her husband Wilbur, Jeremy Piven as the Time Keeper, and Ricky Gervais as the voice of Argonaut, a robotic dog.</p><p>Vega and Sabara also reprised their roles as Carmen and Juni, who helped the new spy kids along the way.</p><p>The movie was not as well-received as the previous ones, but it still had some fun moments and a lot of nostalgia for the fans of the franchise.</p><p>It also used a gimmick called “Aroma-scope”, which allowed the viewers to smell different scents from the movie by scratching and sniffing cards.</p><p>So where are the cast members of Spy Kids: All the Time in the World now?</p><p>Let’s find out!</p><h2><span id=Who_is_the_cute_girl_in_Spy_Kids>Who is the cute girl in Spy Kids?</span></h2><p>If you are wondering who is the cute girl in <a href=#>Spy Kids</a>: All the Time in the World, you might be referring to Rebecca Wilson, who was played by Rowan Blanchard.</p><p>She was 9 years old when she starred in the movie as the rebellious and prank-loving stepdaughter of Marissa Wilson.</p><p>She did not get along with her stepmother at first, but eventually learned to appreciate her and became a spy kid herself.</p><p>Blanchard is now 19 years old and has grown up to be a beautiful and talented actress.</p><p>She is best known for playing Riley Matthews, the daughter of Cory and Topanga from Boy Meets World, in the Disney Channel series Girl Meets World, which ran from 2014 to 2017.</p><p>She also starred in the Disney Channel original movie Invisible Sister in 2015.</p><p>Blanchard has also appeared in movies such as A Wrinkle in Time (2018), where she played Veronica Kiley, a mean girl who bullied Meg Murry; and The Goldfinch (2019), where she played Sophie Barbour, a friend of Theo Decker.</p><p>She also had a recurring role as Alexandra Cavill in the TNT series Snowpiercer (2020-2021), based on the movie of the same name.</p><p>Blanchard is also an activist and a feminist who has spoken out about various social issues such as human rights, LGBTQ+ rights, gun violence prevention, and mental health awareness.</p><p>She has been named one of Time’s most influential teens in 2015 and 2016, and one of Teen Vogue’s 21 Under 21 in 2017.</p><h2><span id=How_old_is_Spy_Kids_4>How old is Spy Kids 4?</span></h2><p>Spy Kids: All the Time in the World was released on August 19, 2011 in the United States.</p><p>That means that as of August 2021, the movie is 10 years old.</p><p>It is hard to believe that it has been a decade since we saw Rebecca and Cecil Wilson join forces with Carmen and Juni Cortez to stop the Time Keeper from speeding up time and destroying the world.</p><p>The movie was directed by Robert Rodriguez, who also directed all the previous Spy Kids movies.</p><p>He wrote, produced, edited, shot, composed, and did visual effects for the movie as well.</p><p>He also cast his own children in some roles: his son Rebel played one of Cecil’s friends at school; his daughter Rhiannon played one of Rebecca’s friends at school; and his son Racer played one of Rebecca’s classmates at OSS.</p><p>The movie had a budget of $27 million and grossed $85.6 million worldwide.</p><p>It was not as successful as the previous movies, which all made over $100 million each.</p><p>The movie also received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized its plot, humor, acting, and use of “Aroma-scope”.</p><p>It has a rating of 22% on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 37 out of 100 on Metacritic.</p><h2><span id=Who_played_the_baby_in_Spy_Kids_4>Who played the baby in Spy Kids 4?</span></h2><p>The baby in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World was Maria Wilson, who was Marissa Wilson’s daughter with Wilbur Wilson.</p><p>She was born at the beginning of the movie after Marissa had a chase scene with Tick Tock while she was in labor.</p><p>Maria was later revealed to be a spy baby, who had a special watch that allowed her to communicate with Argonaut, the robotic dog.</p><p>She also helped her family and the spy kids in their mission to stop the Time Keeper.</p><p>The baby was played by twins Belle and Genny Solorzano, who were credited as Spy Baby in the movie.</p><p>They were about one year old when they filmed the movie. They have not appeared in any other movies or shows since then.</p><p>If you found this article impressive follow our blog for more articles as shown below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLS82GaiopyjYq6tuIytn55lpJ66pnnIp2StoJVixLC%2By51knJmjqXq4tMSrnGaZopp6tbTEsmSnp6dk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-platt-in-broadway-performance-dear-evan-hansen-his-wiki-net-worth-grammy-family-is-he-gay.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Platt in Broadway Performance Dear Evan Hansen.
