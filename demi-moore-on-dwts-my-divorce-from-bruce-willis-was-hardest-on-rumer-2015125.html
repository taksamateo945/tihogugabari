In a feature that also included quotes from Bruce, Moore reflected on raising her daughter and the evolution she’s seen.</p><p>“When she was born, she literally looked like a little magical elf,” Moore gushed of Rumer, now 26. Moore and Bruce, now 60, had their first child after being married for less than a year and went on to welcome daughters <strong>Scout</strong>, now 23, and <strong>Tallulah</strong>, now 21. The three girls grew up in the limelight, traveling with their instantly recognizable parents across the globe for movie shoots, premieres, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>“The kids went everywhere with us,” Moore said on DWTS. “You go through my resume and pretty much, they were there.”</p><p>“We were just constantly moving around. We probably weren’t in the same place for longer than two months at a time,” Tallulah chimed in. “When you’re traveling so much and you’re not in school all the time, my sisters were my friends and we kinda realized how much we love each other and how much we need each other,” added Scout.</p><p>The sisters needed each other more than ever in 1998, when the two stars parted ways, going on to divorce in 2000. Moore later married <strong>Ashton Kutcher </strong>in 2005 and split from the younger star after six years, while Bruce is still married to his second wife <strong>Emma Heming</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“When their father and I decided to divorce it probably had the biggest impact on her,” Moore said of Rumer. The struggle became more pronounced as Rumer suffered public scrutiny for her appearance in the midst of her adolescence.&nbsp;</p><p>“Media attention is tough when you are a kid, it is definitely weird to have that be such public knowledge,” she explained in the segment. “A couple times, things would happen in my family — whatever drama it was — I couldn’t leave my house for a week. As I got older and people started you know, commenting on how I look, that’s when it really started to affect me.”</p><p>Moore took notice of the criticism and stood by her daughter as she worked through it.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There really wasn’t anything I could do to stop it,” the Charlie’s Angels actress said. “Her self-esteem was nothing. I could only just keep loving her and loving her until she could love herself.”&nbsp;</p><p>“When she said, ‘I think I wanna do Dancing With the Stars,’ my whole insides, I have to be honest, were screaming ‘No,'” added Moore. “But, one of the most beautiful things that I’ve witnessed is watching her passion become greater than her fear… It has nothing to do with her being my kid or Bruce’s kid, it has everything to do with just who she is.”</p><p>“I’m crazy about Rumer,” Bruce agreed. “I love her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJuepZliurC70Z5kqKZdmcS1v4ymsGacmau8s6%2FEZp2rp51ir7PBwp5ksKGcoba0edaaqmagkaexpr%2FTZqanZaKquqa%2BjGtnam1hZ4I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-chambers-addresses-estranged-husband-armie-hammers-cannibal-fiasco-473105.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elizabeth Chambers Addresses Estranged Husband Armie Hammers Cannibal Fiasco</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-eddie-mannix-became-the-fixer-of-old-hollywood.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Eddie Mannix Became The Fixer Of Old Hollywood</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
