He has also been an ardent supporter of our community and this sheriff’s office,” <a href=#>read</a> a statement Denver outlet 9News obtained from the organization.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Daughter of ‘Good Times’ Star John Amos Launches GoFundMe Following His Hospitalization and Accusations of Elderly Abuse, His Rep Denies Her Claims</a></p><p>“We take allegations of crimes very seriously.

As of June 8, Amos had reportedly started to feel “100%” healthy after doctors were able to drain the fluid.</p><p>The GoFundMe account set up in his honor has now <a href=#>raised</a> over $12,600 out of its $500,000 goal. Shannon claims the money will be used to help his children travel from other states to see him.</p><p>After Amos initially denied his daughter’s allegations, she made a video stating that she was not “crazy” or “lying” about the safety and well-being of “The Roots” star.</p><p>“All due respect to my father’s response, I understand that this is embarrassing and upsetting and probably not what he would have wanted me to do but it is in his best interest,” she <a href=#>explained</a>.</p><p>Shannon admitted there’s more to the story though she “can’t name names” at the moment due to potential defamation allegations.</p><p>Fans were shocked once again after learning new details about “America’s Dad” and the state of his health.</p><p>“This is <a href=#>heartbreaking</a>.”</p><p>“Oh no! That’s awful. I hope he gets the safe and good care that he needs and <a href=#>deserves</a>!”</p><p>“There are way too many vile and malicious people on this planet.
