Visibly enraged, Kelce confronted the coach known as ‘Big Red’ and inadvertently collided with the 65-year-old, sending him stumbling backwards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There’s nobody I get better than I get him,’ the famously forgiving Reid said of Kelce after winning his second Super Bowl in as many seasons. ‘He’s a competitive kid. He loves to play. He makes me feel young. But my balance is terrible.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For a sport populated by disciplinarian coaches, Kelce’s outburst was a clear code violation – something that warranted an actual punishment rather than Reid’s self-deprecating humor. Instead, Reid was happy to brush it aside, as he’s done with so many other perceived transgressions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Just this week, Reid added embattled former San Diego State punter Matt Araiza two months after the ex-Buffalo Bills draft pick was dropped from a sexual assault lawsuit that briefly derailed his NFL career. Araiza was never charged with a crime and is no longer being sued over the alleged 2021 rape of a 17-year-old girl, but his addition in Kansas City is already being scrutinized by fans and reporters alike.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-4167e9b9c66bbe51 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/23/19/81637351-13118447-image-a-11_1708714952285.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy on February 11" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy on February 11</p><img decoding=async id=i-b7261ab8b1689972 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/23/19/81644207-13118447-image-a-12_1708714998167.jpg height=422 width=634 alt="Andy Reid was quick to dismiss the shocking sideline eruption directed at him by Travis Kelce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Andy Reid was quick to dismiss the shocking sideline eruption directed at him by Travis Kelce&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-1fd1ed4e36c4ec53 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/23/19/81636629-13118447-image-a-13_1708715028933.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Just this week, Reid added embattled former San Diego State punter Matt Araiza (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Just this week, Reid added embattled former San Diego State punter Matt Araiza (pictured)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adding Araiza isn’t a major financial risk. The punter signed a reported minimum deal, which is around $750,000, and the contract is unguaranteed, meaning the Chiefs can cut him without consequence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But there are reputational risks for an NFL coach who has been derided for adding players and staff accused of everything from domestic violence to dog fighting.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kelce is, perhaps, the best example of Reid’s compassion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By overlooking Kelce’s failed marijuana test in 2010, which resulted in his suspension at the University of Cincinnati, Reid and the Chiefs got a third-round steal in the former Bearcats tight end.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Three Super Bowl wins later, Kelce ranks fourth among NFL tight ends in career receptions with 907, fourth in receiving yards with 11,328, and sixth with 74 touchdown catches.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Kelce’s Hall-of-Fame level of play was hardly preordained.

He did things differently than everyone else. Coming here, having to do things a certain way and really organizing and prioritizing his life was a challenge. There were a lot of one-on-one meetings with Coach and a lot of, ‘This is how I want things done.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There were a ton of bumps early on, but Coach’s love and faith for Travis never wavered.

I won’t say anything, I just had my family. I had my family and a sense of hope that I can do it all over again, and I only told two people this post-incarceration — I told two people that I just needed another opportunity, a second chance.
