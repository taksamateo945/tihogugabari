She passed away on Friday, December 30, 2022, in the evening at her home in New York City, according to a report by ABC News. Among her loved ones, the pioneering TV journalist died away peacefully at home.</p><p>The Today show’s first female co-host was Barbara Walters. Her cause of death has not been made public up until this point. She blazed a way in the world of television and carved out a place for herself.</p><p>When we shed some light on the famed journalist’s personal life, we discover that although she was married four times in all, she only had one daughter from those unions. Barbara’s only child is called Jacqueline Dena Guber. For more information on Jacqueline Walters, continue reading.</p><h3>Here’s all you need to know about Barbara Walters’ only daughter Jacqueline Dena Guber</h3><p>Barbara was married multiple times throughout her life, but she only had one adoptive daughter, Jacqueline Dena Guber, also known as Jackie Danforth. During her second marriage to Lee Guber, she welcomed her adoptive daughter Jacqueline into her life.</p><p>From 1963 through 1976, Barbara and Lee Guber were wed for 13 years. During her marriage to her second husband, Walters revealed in a previous interview with NBC that she had about 5 miscarriages.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-487340537-1559x2048-2.jpg alt="is barbara walters daughter taking care of her,barbara walters health,barbara walters death,barbara walters net worth,who is barbara walters husband,who takes care of barbara walters,barbara walters young,barbara walters last photo,does barbara walters have a child,what disease does barbara walters have,barbara walters salary" width=1559 height=2048 sizes="(max-width: 1559px) 100vw, 1559px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Barbara and her then-husband Lee decided to adopt after five years of marriage. When their daughter was born in 1968, they gave her the name Jacqueline Dena Guber in honour of Barbara’s older sister. They concealed Jacqueline’s adoption, though.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u30f89ad10f7d2d071e5fdede4068e350><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Renowned News Anchor Barbara Walters Passes Away At 93 - Know Her Legacy & Cause Of Death</span></a><p>Walters stated in a media interview that she made the decision to conceal her daughter’s adoption in part because she “truly didn’t want the biological mother to know” that Jackie had been taken in by her adoptive parents.</p><h3>Barbara’s daughter Jacqueline Dena Guber struggled with addiction</h3><p>Yes, it is what you read. Jacqueline Dena Guber, Barbara’s daughter, grew up in front of cameras because her mother was a well-known TV personality, but she struggled to keep up with her mother’s fame.</p><p>In a 2002 interview with Jane Pauley of NBC News, Jacqueline spoke up about her upbringing and mentioned how she felt out of place. She recalled at the time, “I never felt like I belonged in her world.”</p><p>Danforth started skipping classes when she was a young adolescent in order to spend more time in the New York nightlife. She reportedly attempted using amphetamine, Valium, and other narcotics to mask her discomfort, according to a story by The List.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jacqueline-danforth-struggled-with-addiction-1672464941.jpg alt="is barbara walters daughter taking care of her,barbara walters health,barbara walters death,barbara walters net worth,who is barbara walters husband,who takes care of barbara walters,barbara walters young,barbara walters last photo,does barbara walters have a child,what disease does barbara walters have,barbara walters salary" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jacqueline left her house in 1985 and travelled 800 miles by hitchhiking in a single month. Barbara was upset at the time, but she followed the expert’s advise and refrained from calling the police.</p><p>When Walters learned where her daughter Jacqueline was, she sent a Green Beret to transport Guber to an Idaho wilderness intervention camp. To send a child away is heartbreaking, she added. She continued, “My baby? My infant is no longer under my care. Do I have to pass her on to someone else? I also did.</p><p>Guber was then prepared to start his recovery. She stated in the same interview, “At that time in my life, I glanced around for whatever reason. And I pondered, “What the heck?” This is not a problem. I would not have survived if my mother hadn’t called the transport firm.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub39b9a1d2ae77ee5653470152df3279e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Renowned News Anchor Barbara Walters Passes Away At 93 - Know Her Legacy & Cause Of Death</span></a><p>Guber eventually relocated to Maine, where she married outdoor guide Mark Danforth. Soon after, she started her own teen girl wilderness rehabilitation programme. Jacqueline is 54 years old at the moment.</p><h3>Jacqueline Danforth experienced some hard times in her life</h3><p>Jacqueline Danforth went through some challenging circumstances in her life. Unfortunately, since she and her mother sat down for the interview, Jacqueline has encountered additional issues. After seven years, her wilderness rehabilitation programme for young women, New Horizons for Young Women, was discontinued in 2008.</p><p>On her website, Danforth announced that her wilderness therapy programme will be shutting. She continued by saying that the programme could no longer run because of a financial crisis. “I have been so lucky to have acquired the most fantastic education and relationships from this field,” she wrote at the time.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/barbara-walters-jackie-gruber-daughter-feature.jpg alt="is barbara walters daughter taking care of her,barbara walters health,barbara walters death,barbara walters net worth,who is barbara walters husband,who takes care of barbara walters,barbara walters young,barbara walters last photo,does barbara walters have a child,what disease does barbara walters have,barbara walters salary" width=780 height=470 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>TMZ claims that Jacqueline was detained by the police for DUI in 2013 while she was in Naples, Florida. The term “DUI” means for “driving under the influence,” for those of you who are uninformed.</p><p>At that point, Jacqueline was seen with a man who was thought to be her new lover rather than her husband Mark Danforth. She allegedly behaved belligerently against the cops, according to the police report. She was later released after posting a $1,000 bond.</p><p>Jacqueline, Barbara’s sole child, has avoided the <a href=#>spotlight</a> ever since. Her current residence, marital status, and employment are unknown as of the time of writing.</p><h3>Barbara Walters was married four times to three husbands</h3><p>Robert Henry Katz and Barbara were married for the first time. In the year 1955, the couple exchanged vows, and two years later, in the year 1957, they divorced. She continued living her life with Lee Guber shortly after.</p><p>The television personality and theatrical producer Lee Guber, her second husband, were married in 1976. The couple adopted their daughter Jacqueline Dena Guber while they were still married.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-156108696-1550x2048-1.jpg alt="is barbara walters daughter taking care of her,barbara walters health,barbara walters death,barbara walters net worth,who is barbara walters husband,who takes care of barbara walters,barbara walters young,barbara walters last photo,does barbara walters have a child,what disease does barbara walters have,barbara walters salary" width=1550 height=2048 sizes="(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u3cd671b49248d3c151aad3193c56cce7><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Renowned News Anchor Barbara Walters Passes Away At 93 - Know Her Legacy & Cause Of Death</span></a><p>Nearly 5 years after her breakup with Lee, Walters wed Lorimar Television CEO Merv Adelson.
