Attracting a global fanbase, the show also has its remakes in countries like France, Italy, Australia, The United Kingdom, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The eighth rendition of the show was shot and based in Potomac, Maryland, and premiered on January 17, 2016. The rendition itself has been running successfully for 6 seasons now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Among all the participants and women depicted in the show, this article is about Mia Thornton, who just got the main lead in the sixth season of the RHOP.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Mia Thornton</a> </strong>recently opened up about the most unconventional place she met her husband, <strong>Gordon Thornton</strong>. In the most reason episode of the show aired and produced by Bravo, the couple who have now been married for a long time revealed that they actually met at a “strip club” during a newlyweds game with other Real Housewives of Potomac couples.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So the burning question remains, <a href=# rel=noopener>what brought them together</a>?</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsgraphy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mia-Thornton-with-her-husband-Gordon-Thornton_1621960801.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=LOVE_AT_A_STRIP_CLUB_Not_really></span><strong>LOVE AT A STRIP CLUB? Not really!&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>“The reason why we became friends is that we partnered and served on the same board for a non-profit organization to raise money for Haiti,“ Mia Thornton told E-News during an interview. “We were raising money for the cause. One of the ladies, one of the founders of the organization, worked there—not as an entertainer, but in the admin office, and so she did use the facility to raise money. First, they serve steak dinners, and then the proceeds went to the organization.”</span></p><p><span>It was a good cause that brought the couple together, and Mia said that she was with Gordon, who was only a friend back then, in the strip club to raise money for charity, but not everyone on the show seems to believe her story.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>The Untold Truth About Damon Wayan’s Ex-Wife, Lisa Thorner</strong></a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=NOT_A_POPULAR_STORY></span><strong>NOT A POPULAR STORY</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Some participants of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Real Housewives of Potomac</strong></a> have vocalized their opinions about Mia’s sweet romantic story of meeting her husband. “First you don’t know your age, then within 24hours you go from her having a “good heart” to “just a pretty face,” then you say you’re a bartender when we all know you’re a stripper. So many lies… but go off sis.”, Wendy Osefo a participant on the show tweeted on July 18.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsgraphy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mia-Thornton-with-her-husband-and-kids_1621960765.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=BEING_A_GRANNY></span><strong>BEING A GRANNY</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Mia and Gordon met back in 2003 and have since welcomed two children into the world. Mia already had children from her previous marriage, and in addition to that, the couple recently became grandparents.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Gordon is 32 years older than I, and we do have grandbabies,” said Mia. “We have four beautiful grandbabies. Two are adults moving into the college world, and two are in grade school. Of course, I feel like the two younger ones are my birth grandchildren because I helped name them. I was there to be a part of their birth and things like that, but it’s been great. We have such a blended family. His kids are phenomenal. His daughter calls me for advice, so it’s just really great. It’s just natural.”, she added.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Real Housewives of Potomac airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on the Bravo TV network. The past seasons are all available on the OTT platform Peacock. Both the channels are parts of NBC Network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>For more interesting content and updates regarding your favorite celebrities, please stay connected with us at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebsgraphy</a>.</strong></p><p><h2 class=prime-color-text>Tags</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FGq5ipoKljsLC5jqagmmWknbyzutOopWagpaivorrDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga-new-song-and-music-video-2015189.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga's &amp;quot;Til It Happens to You&amp;quot; Music Video Focuses on Campus Rape</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carlos-alvarez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carlos Alvarez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
