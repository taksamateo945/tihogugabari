It has been gaining streams on Spotify and has become his second most streamed track to date – only just, it will become his top streamed song very soon.</p><p>From the minute we heard it, we knew it was something that we’d listen to on repeat. It’s instantly catchy and completely one of our favourite tracks at this very moment. <a href=#>Check out our full review of the song</a>.</p><p>We were completely lucky to get the chance to interview Danny Dearden. He answered our questions, and we enjoyed his answers completely. We chatted about the new single, gigging, and his hopes for the future. We also asked him whether a music video would be coming out, he has since dropped the said music video after our interview. Here is our exclusive interview with Danny Dearden.</p><p><strong>Hey Danny, we hope your day is going well. What have you been up to recently?</strong></p><p>Hi mate, recently I’ve been in the studio a lot. My main focus has been writing and recording my own tracks and to get a great group of songs together, ready to release throughout 2018.</p><p><strong>You dropped a&nbsp;brand new&nbsp;single, titled “Take On The World”. Can you tell us more about it?</strong></p><p>Yeah ‘Take On The World’ was written in a session with Joe and Seff from The Holografik and Jack Kelly. It was the first time we had all met, we had never worked together prior to that.</p><p>So we were all buzzing that our first session had gone so well.</p><p>It was written over a year ago now. Me and my manager were listening through some of my tracks and just thought we should release this now as the time felt right.</p><p><strong>What does the song mean to you?</strong></p><p>I personally love it – well I would haha – but it’s my first real pop release that I feel represents me as an artist. I also love the production, the Holografik lads did a great job on that. Keeping that current up-to-date sound but also keeping it organic with real instruments in the mix which represents the lads too.</p><p><strong>What are your favourite lyrics from the song?</strong></p><p>My favourite lyrics from the song…. mmm… I have to say the title ‘Take On The World’.</p><p><strong>It has already become your second most-streamed song on Spotify, with nearly 10,400 streams. What’s it like knowing so many people have listened to the song?</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s doing great on Spotify. It hasn’t got millions of streams, but for an independent release with little promotion, it’s good.</p><p>It’s amazing knowing people are hearing your music and liking it from all over the world. You can go into the settings on Spotify and it shows you the cities and countries it’s been played in – mental!</p><p><strong>What has the reaction to the song been like?</strong></p><p>The reaction has been great. We went to number 12 on the iTunes singer-songwriter chart on the day it was released which was sick. I didn’t expect that at all, so cheers everyone.</p><p><strong>Your previous single, “Sleeping&nbsp;With&nbsp;The Moon”, got a music video, can we expect one for “Take On The World”? If so, can you reveal any details?</strong></p><p>Yes, there is a video coming very soon. It was filmed&nbsp;on the south shields beach. It was the hottest day of the year so far which was amazing, it couldn’t have gone any better really. Everyone looked liked lobsters after the shoot though as we all fried in the sun haha.</p><p></p><p><strong>Last time we saw you live was at <a href=#>Yes Lad’s Spring Tour at Birmingham’s O2 Academy 3</a>. What was it like performing at Yes Lad’s gig?</strong></p><p>The Yes Lad gig was great. The fans were amazing. It was a proper vibe. The lads were great too. I had a top night and I can’t wait to get on stage again soon. Keep an eye out on my Facebook and Twitter for upcoming gigs.</p><p></p><p><strong>Looking over your career to date, what has been your biggest highlight?</strong></p><p>I’d say my biggest highlight to date is releasing my own music. After spending so long in the studio and getting songs together, to finally get it out there for people to listen to, is the main goal really. I can’t wait for all the future releases this year too. Fingers crossed everyone is going to like the tracks.</p><p><strong>What do you hope to achieve in music in the upcoming years?</strong></p><p>Well, the dream would be to get a number one haha, but for now, I’m going to focus on getting great songs written and then getting them released so everyone can hear them.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from you in the future, music wise?</strong></p><p>I have a track coming out this summer with a big producer/artist that has had hits all over the world, which is exciting, can’t wait for that one. I also have some more collaborations coming up too with some amazing artists. And also in between that, I’m going to be releasing my own music too.</p><p><strong>If you could collaborate with anyone in the world, who would you choose and why?</strong></p><p>Ahhh that’s a hard one as there are so many.</p><p>I would have loved to have performed with Michael Jackson or Whitney as they were two amazingly talented artists. If I had to pick someone who is alive today I’d probably say Beyoncé, her voice is insane.</p><p><strong>And, finally, do you have a message for your fans?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I’d just like to say a massive thanks to everyone for supporting me, sharing, listening to my music, I hope your all gonna like the stuff I have coming up.</p><p>Also big thanks to you for the interview mate.</p><p>You are very welcome Danny Dearden. We love your music and can’t wait to see what you release next. Thank you so much for the interview too, and we just know the future is going to be so bright for you.</p><p>Don’t forget, you can download and stream Danny Dearden’s recently released song, “Take On The World”, featuring The Holografik, on all platforms, right now. A music video for the song has also been released.</p><h4>What do you think of our interview with Danny Dearden?
