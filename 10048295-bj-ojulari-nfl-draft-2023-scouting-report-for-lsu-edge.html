For example, against Tennessee and Darnell Wright, Ojulari worked the edges more since Wright has a good anchor, but against Ole Miss, he relied more on turning speed to power against the Rebels' weaker tackles.</p><p>If he can improve his use of hands on his finesse moves and add some strength to be more effective when bull-rushing, Ojulari will be a dangerous pass-rusher in the pros. However, his effectiveness against the run is holding his draft stock back.</p><p>While the Tiger is effective against reach blocks/outside zone, on base blocks he concedes too much ground and will struggle to hold up at the point of attack against NFL tackles. Adding some mass will help there too, but he is very reliant on working around blocks right now, which is a risky play style.</p><p>Schematically, Ojulari might be limited to a stand-up outside linebacker role in odd fronts. He's just not big and strong enough to put his hand in the ground as a defensive end in even fronts right now. But if a team is looking for immediate pass-rushing help and is willing to be patient with him against the run, he's worth a mid-to-late first-round pick.</p><p><b>GRADE: </b>7.9 (Potential Impact Player)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK:</b> 24</p><p><b>POSITION RANK: </b>EDGE5</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON: </b>Jaelan Phillips</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZG1%2FeoGMm6Fmp5qquaK%2ByGaln6Rdmb%2BistNmaWlqY2LApLvUraCnn12nsrG70a1kn6eiYrm0wYyem6Cd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./55525-john-corbett-biography-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Corbett bio: height, pictures, net worth, girlfriends, is he married?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./porsha-williams-celebrates-the-birthday-of-her-baby-cousin-and-shares-gorgeous-pics-of-her-373226.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Porsha Williams Celebrates The Birthday Of Her Baby Cousin And Shares Gorgeous Pics Of Her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./warm-scarf-material-html.html>Warm scarf material</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2902098-mike-trout-signed-rookie-card-sells-for-393m-to-break-all-time-record.html>Mike Trout Signed Rookie Card Sells for $3.93M to Break All-Time Record | News, Scores, Highlights,</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./words-with-carte-or-mode-2-wds-html.html>Words with carte or mode: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./statute-of-limitations-doesnt-apply-to-clinton-case.html>Statute of Limitations Doesn't Apply to Clinton Case</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./colby-brock.html>Colby Brock- Biography, Age, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Religion</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
