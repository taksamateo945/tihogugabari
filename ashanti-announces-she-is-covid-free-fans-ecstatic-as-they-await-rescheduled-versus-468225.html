Yes I went to Nairobi; I had an amazing time. No, I did not get COVID from traveling. I did not get COVID from being in Africa or anything like that. Everyone that I went on the trip with has tested [negative]. hey went from country to country; they went to Uganda so they have to continue to get tested. No one&nbsp;tested positive. I did not get it from traveling.’</p><p>Instead, it was in her own home.</p><p>‘I actually got it from&nbsp;a family member when I came home. I came home and I hugged a family member who ended up being positive. I didn’t know he was positive; he didn’t know he was positive, so when he went to get tested, I was like, ‘Oh f***.’’</p><p>‘Now we gone need you to wear your mask 😷 everywhere you go because if you cancel that <a href=# title="Monica And Brandy To Go Head To Head In Verzuz Battle"><strong>Verzuz</strong></a> 1 mo time!’</p><p>Another added: ‘DONT TRAVEL NOWHERE UNTIL AFTER THE VERZUZ BATTLE!!!
