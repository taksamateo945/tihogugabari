The question comes up very often due to how tall he seems on the screen compared to his fellow actors, and he has spoken on it before, saying:</p>I am 6-foot, 5-inches and most actresses are tiny compared to me. The funny thing is they do not ever put them on a box. When I was doing TV, they would make the guys stand on these things called apple boxes, but for some reason, they do not put the girls on boxes. Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, all those guys probably come in at about 5-foot 10-inches tops, so I am a little oversized for a leading man.<h2>John Corbett net worth</h2><p class=align-left>According to Celebrity Net Worth, he is worth an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimated</a> $9.5 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/d8420fffc1a2d682.jpg><p class=align-left>That concludes our biography on John Corbett.
